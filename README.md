# William Schmidt Portfolio Website

This repo contains the source for my personal portfolio website.

The site is hosted through GitHub Pages. You can view the site by clicking [this link](https://wcs3.github.io/).

This site is built using plain HTML and styled with the help of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The static nature of the site makes this simple technology stack sufficient.
